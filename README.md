Basic Query Test
Learnings:
  /bye is used to kill the model when its running in cmd otherwise it will keep running.
  It takes some  time for it to shut down.
  The return message is in Unicode, so some special characters will not print properly to the console.

Result:
The infamous line said by Hamlet in Shakespeare's play is:

**"To be, or not to be, that is the question."**

It's a famously complex and layered line that encapsulates Hamlet's contemplation of life, death, suffering, and inaction. It's a rhetorical question, but it's profoundly weighty and open to multiple interpretations. 

It's often translated as "To be or not to be, is the question."


Do you want to know more about the context of this line or explore its meaning in detail?
